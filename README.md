# register file Verilog-code #
A register file in Verilog is a collection of registers, typically used in processors or other digital circuits, that stores multiple values.
The register file is a multi-port memory module that stores a set of registers, each capable of holding a fixed-size data word (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit).

In above reopistroy 
it contain two files hello.v and hello_tb.v
hello_tb.v is bascilly a test bench file, test file is used in to ensure the timing and functionalaity requirements.
Verilog Test benches are used to simulate and analyze designs without the need for any physical hardware or any hardware device.
